I started this project over a year ago and never finishd it.

Until now. 

*cinematic music starts playing*

This program, dubbed 'Cabinet', takes two path inputs. One for the folder
you want sorted, one for the folder you want it sorted to. Once you give
a location for it, you can begin sorting.
<br>

That's it.
It's that easy.
<br>

But wait! There's more.
Now that you have given paths, it saves them in a text file. Don't worry,
you don't have to do anything with the text file. So what is it for? Why, thank
you for asking! This text file saves the last location given so that you don't 
have to copy and paste folders every single time. Pretty exciting right? Well 
no, not really, but it is helpful!
<br>
That is all. Thank you for listening.
